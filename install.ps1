.SYNOPSIS
    A simple "no-brainer" PowerShell script to install gpt-files on Windows.

.DESCRIPTION
    1. Auto-detects Admin vs Non-Admin mode.
    2. Downloads the binary from a GitHub release URL.
    3. Installs to a suitable directory (Program Files or LocalAppData).
    4. Ensures that directory is on the PATH so you can invoke the binary anywhere.
